# Struct Mapping Visualizer - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Go Struct Mapping Visualizer  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Target Audience:** Backend developers working with Go, particularly those dealing with complex struct transformations  
**Technology Stack:** React + Vite, React Flow, DaisyUI, TypeScript

## Executive Summary

The Struct Mapping Visualizer is a web-based tool that enables developers to visually design, document, and generate mapping relationships between Go structs. The tool addresses the common challenge of understanding and maintaining complex data transformations in Go applications by providing an intuitive visual interface for mapping struct fields and defining transformation logic.

## Problem Statement

- Developers often struggle to understand complex struct-to-struct mappings in large codebases
- Manual mapping code is error-prone and difficult to maintain
- Lack of visual documentation for data transformation flows
- Time-consuming process to create and update mapping functions
- Difficulty in onboarding new team members to understand existing mappings

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Visual Mapping Creation**: Enable users to visually create mappings between Go struct fields
2. **Code Generation**: Generate Go transformation functions based on visual mappings
3. **Documentation**: Provide clear visual documentation of data flows
4. **Productivity**: Reduce time spent writing boilerplate mapping code

### Success Metrics

- Reduce mapping code creation time by 70%
- Improve code review efficiency for struct transformations
- Enable faster onboarding for complex mapping logic
